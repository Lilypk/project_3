# Dog Breeds  

Click on the drop down in the right top corner of the page. Here you will see a list of five different dog breeds. To see images of each breed, simply click on the breed name. 

## Description 

For this project, I used the Hamburger Menu UI pattern and the dog API. The dog API was easy to use with simple instructions. 

## Layout 

I started out with my HTML and css. I got the drop down menu to work by creating a hidden class and an event listener. When the three lines are clicked, the hidden class (with the list) will appear. I used toggle so that when the three lines are clicked again, the list will disappear. My next step was fetching my API. This part was pretty simple, I just needed the dog breed API and dog images API. My first function is fetching the dog breed API, creating a list element, feeding the list with the first five dog breeds that came up from the response, and appending that list to the drop down menu. My second function is fetching the dog images API, creating an image element and a container for them to be in, and looping through 6 times to receive six images. I then appended the image to the image container.
